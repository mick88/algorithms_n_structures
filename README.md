## Solutions to coding problems

Michal Dabski

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from [Cracking the Coding Interview book](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Fourth-Edition/dp/145157827X).

Disclaimer: Not all of the solutions are the best solutions to a given problem; the book itself contains optimal solutions at the end. Solutions presented here are merely my own implementations without looking at the "correct" solution.
